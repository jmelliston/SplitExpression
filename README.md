### Summary of SplitExpression ###

The SplitExpression package extends the xTensor package to allow 
for simple decomposition of tensorial expressions by splitting index 
summations into parts and automatically defining new tensors as required. 
Functionality is also provided to define the decomposition of tensors, as is usually desired. 
We also provide the facility for single index components to be rewritten as parameters, 
avoiding unneccesary indices. The motivation behind this package is to provide low-level 
functionality for operations such as the 3+1 ADM split in General Relativity.

### Getting the SplitExpression package working ###

**Dependencies**

1) Mathematica.

2) xAct (freely available at http://xact.es, along with installation instructions)

**Installation**

1) If not already done, check that you can run the default xAct package example files.

2) Download the SplitExpression repository file 
and place it at the top level within the xAct directory, wherever it is on your computer. 

3) Open the examples file and run it. If it runs, the installation worked.
